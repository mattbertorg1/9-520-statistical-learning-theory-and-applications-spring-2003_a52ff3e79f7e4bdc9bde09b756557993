Project
-------

([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/projects2002))

For the final project, students select from one of the following suggested topics, and solve the problem that is described. If students prefer, they can bring their own project ideas to the professor or TAs for approval.

Topics:  
Hypothesis testing with small sets  
Connection between MED and regularization  
Feature selection for SVMs theory and experiments  
Bayes classification rule and SVMs  
IOHMMs evaluation of HMMs for classification vs. direct classification  
Reusing the test set datamining bounds  
Large-scale nonlinear least square regularization  
Viewbased classification  
Local vs. global classifiers experiments and theory  
RKHS invariance to measure historical math  
Concentration experiments (dot product vs. square distance)  
Decorrelating classifiers: experiments about generalization using a tree of stumps  
Kernel synthesis and selection  
Bayesian interpretation of regularization and in particular of SVMs  
History of induction from Kant to Popper and current state  
Bayesian Priorhood
